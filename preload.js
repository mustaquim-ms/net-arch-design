// This file can be used to expose APIs to the renderer process
// For example, you can expose functions to interact with the main process
// or to handle IPC communication.  


// Currently, it is empty as per the provided context.

// You can add functionality as needed in the future.
// This is a placeholder for preload.js
// If you need to expose any APIs or functionalities, you can do so here.
// For example, you can use contextBridge to expose methods or properties


// to the renderer process, allowing secure communication between the main and renderer processes.
// This is useful for Electron applications to maintain security and separation of concerns.
